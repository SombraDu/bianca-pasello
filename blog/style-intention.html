            <h3>Your brand narrative emphasizes confidence. How do you achieve this through  the details?</h3>

            <p>
              The fit of a garment is really important to me. I achieve this in the pattern making, which is when it's  two-dimensional  and  all about geometry and measurements of the human body. There's a lot of measurements that are pretty much the same on  a lot of sizes as far as just the difference from waist to hip. And kind of just knowing human anatomy and creating patterns that work with it rather than against it has been probably the biggest part for that.
