            <h1>SUSTAINABILITY</h1>

            <h3>How has sustainability impacted your campaign and the visual aspect of your brand?</h3>

            <p>
              It has impacted the visual aspect a little bit because I do love to work with denim and using kind of raw edges and working with the shapes that I have when using fabric scraps. So I think that it's really helped me work geometrically within my designs which I really enjoy doing. It still has stayed true as far as  the aesthetic hasn't changed due to sustainability. But it has inspired some interesting works of mine that I wouldn't have achieved without it.
